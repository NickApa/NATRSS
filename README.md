# Spill Tracker and Calculator

![spilltrackerReadmeLogo](Milestone5/spilltrackerReadmeLogo.png "NATRSS")

# Description
For environmental workers who need to report spills or look up information about chemicals if a report is needed. The Chemical Spill Tracker is an information system that will allow users to calculate whether or not a spill at the company or location will need to be reported to the proper authorities and if so, who to contact. 

We are creating this project as a continuation of our courses at Western Oregon University for the Computer Science Program. Courses in this program for the Senior Capstone are: CS460 - Software Engineering I, CS461 - Software Engineering II, CS462 - Software Engineering III. As well as prerequisite courses CS361 - Algorithms, CS364 - Information Systems.

# Background
Under Title 40 Chapter I SubChapter J Parts 302 and 355 of the Code of Federal Regulations in the USA, requirements are established for facilites to submit emergency notification of chemical releases for designated chemicals on the [List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt40.28.302&rgn=div5#se40.30.302_14) and [List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5bda0c1c4736b83aaf402bed85944e07&mc=true&node=pt40.30.355&rgn=div5#ap40.30.355_161.a).

We use equation 7 from the [EPA's Technical Guidance for Hazard Analysis Appx. G ยง2](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-08/documents/technical_guidance_for_hazard_analysis.pdf) to calculate the evaporation rate (rate of volatilization) for spilled pools of chemicals.

## SQL Style
- Primary keys will be named 'ID'
- Foreign Keys will include the table and ID where it came from - "ChemicalID"
- Constraints will be sperated by a '_' - "Form_FK_Chemical"

## GIT
- Use separate feature branches.
- Only commit working code (Unless others require your code to help fix a bug) and commit often.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Pull the upstream development code and merge it into your feature branch before submitting a Pull Request.
- Pull Request must be made to the dev branch. All other pull requests will be rejected.
- GitHub Repo Master will merge the dev branch into the main branch after Sprint Meetings
