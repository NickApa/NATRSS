# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## 1. Conduct a Safety Check if you can meet in person; what were the results? If you're holding it remotely, choose a different activity method from Fun Retrospectives.

### The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Retrospective
 

#### The Good
- Website functions as expected as this point. no bugs beyond minor typos found
- Communication between members has been good
- No merge conflicts so far (woot-woot!)
- Pivotal Tracker usage has been good. User story details and acceptance criteria improving each sprint

#### The Bad
- Continue to work on time we get things done. Try to not resolve issues in the last hour before the project advisor meeting
- Our UI in comparison to other groups demos seems simplistic. Plan to improve more in future sprints
- Still missing chemical data
- Better use of meeting times to focus on group tasks

#### The Ugly
- Diagrams and drawings are out of date
- Update/refactor git repo. remove school work and make repo more professional 


## 2. What did you learn from the Sprint?
- Can get a lot of work done in a 24 point sprint period
- Working on limiting blockers or relying on other user stories to be completed to finish other work
- Client side / UI / Javascript isnt always as simple as immediately thought to be
- Adapting well to issues found in completing user stories (ex: the alias solution reduced our chemical count by ~400) 
- Spelling
- We need to address how to handle authorization for access to pages/controllers

## 3. What isn't going well?
- Completing work in a timely manner
- Asking for help earlier when its needed

## 4. What can the team do better during the next Sprint? You must make a specific Action Plan.
- Change of focus towards users stories that implement the core features of the site
- Continue developing communication of team member availability for free to work or gone for vacations / stuck at work longer than anticipated
- Getting all team member comfortable with on demand deployment via the Python scripts

## 5. Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team?
- None at this time
