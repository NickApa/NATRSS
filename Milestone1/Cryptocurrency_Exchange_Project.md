# PROJECT IDEA
Create a simple cryptocurrency exchange application
## Description -
The crypto exchange will allows users to purchase, trade, mine and stake crytpo currencies using our proprietary token called Fire coin. Fire coins can be staked on a node (called a Torch) via the NATR network allowing users to lock in cryptocurrencies to receive rewards such as WIND. More fire coins can be mined with the use of WIND, essentially spreading the fire. Once enough Fire coin is generated, the user can then purchase other crypto currencies on the exchange using Fire coins which has a stable price value of 1 US Dollar per 1 FireCoin.   

## Problem Statement - 
All though it is ideal for all features to be added, the ability to purchase andsell crypto as well as staking firecoins are the only mandatory features for this project.

## Solution - 
Add as many features as desired by the group

### API Usage:
The coinbase pro API should be used to list atleast 2 ERC-20 tokens on the exchange. 

### Database Usage:
SQL Server database used to keeps  records of portfolio balance, and user information.

### Algorithmic Component
Users should be able to buy and sell cryptos based on the current market price and exchange rate. Users should be able to generate rewards based on yield percentages.
