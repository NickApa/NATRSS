# Where To Next

## Q: Why is this an original idea? What are related websites or apps?

Currently, no site on the internet can do what this website will do. There are many websites that can do one or two facets of the WhereToNext website, however none can do each main feature.
Websites like zillow, census bureaus and other demographic websites cover part of this idea. 

## Q: Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?

This website would be useful because it would bring all searches into one site. You would no longer need to go to multiple sites to find all the data you need. This site is helpful for 
college students trying to decide where to go next that best suites them, it is also good for adults looking to make a life change and can be helpful for anyone who wants to know more about
where they currently live. 

## Q: What are a few major features?

1- Be able to look up jobs in your particular industry to find the best job market and where salaries are the best, as well as where the most jobs in that industry are.
2- Be able to look at the cost of living in a particular area.
3- Be able to look up the cost of houses, apartments or other places to live in a given location.
4- Be able to see demographic data of a particular area or location.
5- See which areas have the best schools, restuaraunts, or stores and other life needs in an area.
6- Be able to store past searches and filters to pick up where you left off.
7- Have an algorithm find the best place for you to live based on your specific needs and wants.
8- Be able to look at a map or have a table printed out with information you want.

## Q: What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class?

Will need to use a maps feature to show locations and areas to live.

## Topic difficulty rating - 7-8/10
The difficulty of this project is it mostly lies in the use of API's, a lot of AJAX and javascript will be required and they will all have to work together. A database design will also be 
required and it wont be the most difficult but will have a lot of different data to store. A lot of components will rely on other features and may cause it easy to get behind if one feature
does not quite work.
