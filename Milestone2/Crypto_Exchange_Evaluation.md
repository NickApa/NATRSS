#Team Project Ideas

Develop each of your ideas a little more. Do some background research and look for existing solutions. Evaluate your topics thoroughly and then choose TWO to continue with (or your advisor will have discarded one or more already). Write up a short explanation of each topic, that describes it more than you did for Milestone 1. Additionally, answer these questions for each topic:

##What is new/original about this idea? 
This app allows users to simulate trading cryptocurrencies using a proprietary coin called Fire Coin. GIves users expert analysis and tips on the market, and gives users acces to firecoin.
##What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
Coinbase Pro/ Coinbase / Binance.us


##Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
The crypto_exchange simulator can provide trading experience with out the financial risk. It can also provide trading tips and information to keep users informed of industry news/trends

##What are a few major features?
Buying and Selling Feature, Mining/Staking Fire Coin on a defi finance app made from scratch.

##What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
This project requires use of Coinbase Pro's Public Rest API

##What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
Exchange rate algorithm for buying and selling currencies.
Interest yield algorithm for generating wind assets while staking Fire coin
Interest yield algorithm for borrow you take 0.01% crypto daily rate, 0,025% daily rate on USDT, and rates change all the time

## Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

I would rate the project an 9 only because to create a crypto currency will require a really good architecture/use case and a little bit of outside study.
